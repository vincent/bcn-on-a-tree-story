     Oh weary traveler, won't you come my way?

<br> Oh dear reader, come closer to me
<br> My leaves rustle, can't you see?
<br> I long for your presence, day by day
<br> Come sit with me, and rest awhile, I pray
<br> 
<br> My bark is rough, and my roots run deep
<br> But your company is what I truly seek
<br> Come closer, feel the warmth of my embrace
<br> And together, let's share this sacred space
